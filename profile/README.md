## Hi there 👋

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about? This is just for the showing something what I'm capable of doing so a small repository list from the world of web development.
Repos include web development projects done with the React webpack and with the Vite. I will add more projects to this location once I get these pollished. These however will be improved time to time ... so nothing is ready ... ever.

🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved? No need this is just for me and for anyonce intrested to hire me :)


🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
